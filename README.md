#A set of Node-RED nodes to access Tinkerforge bricklets

These nodes make use of [Tinkerforge's][1] [javascript][2] library to connect 
to a local brickd instance or to a remote instance (via Ethernet/WiFi brick)

##Install

From npm

npm install node-red-contrib-tinkerforge

or to from the git head stream

npm install hardillb/node-red-contrib-tinkerforge

##Supported Bricklets

Currently there are nodes for the following bricklets

 - Humidity Bricklet
 - Moisture Bricklet
 - Temperature Bricklet
 - CO2 Bricklet
 - Industrial Diginal In 4 Bricklet
 - Industrial Diginal Out 4 Bricklet
 - PTC Bricklet
 - LED Strip Bricklet
 - Motion Detector Bricklet
 - Analog Out Bricklet 2.0
 - Ambient Light Bricklet
 - Ambient Light Bricklet v2
 - Remote Switch Bricklet
 - Industrial Analog Out Bricklet
 - Industrial Dual Analog In Bricklet
 - Dual Relay Bricklet

Adding more should be pretty trivial, these are just the bricks I currently 
access to for testing
